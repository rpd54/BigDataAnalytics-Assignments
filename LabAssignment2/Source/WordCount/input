New details have emerged surrounding Sunday's deadly joint US-United Arab Emirates counterterrorism raid on an
al Qaeda compound in Yemen, shedding light on why the mission happened when it did -- and what went wrong.

The military said the operation was geared toward collecting as much intelligence on the terror group as possible
in order to facilitate future raids and strikes against al Qaeda down the road and prevent terror attacks.The
raid was greenlit by President Donald Trump shortly after taking the oath of office, but multiple officials told
CNN the mission had been planned months in advance and had been briefed to then-President Barack Obama.Both
defense and Obama administration officials said the operation was never vetoed by Obama and that "operational
reasons" were why it was pushed back after January 20 and why Obama left the task of authorizing the raid to his
successor.
